# **Amazon Clone Project - Zema Coders**
## Project Description
This is a collaborative Amazon Clone project led by Zema Coders to help junior developers gain real-world experience. The project follows industry best practices, allowing developers to work in teams, understand Git workflows, and build a scalable e-commerce platform using the MERN + MySQL stack.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend:
- React.js (with Redux Toolkit for state management)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Axios (for API communication)

### Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js (Server-side framework)
- MySQL (Relational Database)
- Sequelize (ORM for MySQL)
- Passport.js (Authentication)
### **Other Tools**:
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
- Postman (API Testing)

### **Git Workflow Rules**
- To ensure smooth collaboration, we follow a structured Git workflow:

### **1 Branching Strategy**
We use feature-based branching:

- `main` → The production-ready code (Only admins merge here)
- `develop` → The integration branch for all new features
- `feature/xxx` → A branch for each new feature (e.g., feature/authentication)

### **2 How to Work on a Feature**
1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZemaCoders/amazon-clone.git
cd amazon-clone
```
2. **Create a new feature branch**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
3. **Make changes and commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added authentication with Passport.js"
```
4. **Push your changes**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
5. **Create a pull request (PR) to develop branch**

### **3 Commit Message Format**
We follow a clear commit message convention:

- `feat`: → Adding a new feature
- `fix`: → Fixing a bug
- `chore`: → Maintenance and setup
- `docs`: → Updating documentation

### **Contribution Rules**
- Always create a feature branch before making changes
- Never push directly to main or develop
- Make sure your PR is reviewed before merging
- Use clear commit messages
